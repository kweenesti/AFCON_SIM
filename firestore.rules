/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for African Nations Tournament Simulator
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for federations and their associated player data, while allowing public read access to country data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /countries/{countryId}: Publicly accessible data about countries.
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data, readable only by the owning user.
 * - /federations/{federationId}: Federation data, accessible only to the authenticated user with the matching federationId.
 * - /federations/{federationId}/players/{playerId}: Player data nested under federations, accessible only to the owning federation.
 * - /tournaments/{tournamentId}: Tournament data. Can only be created by admins, but readable by all.
 * - /matches/{matchId}: Match data. Can only be created/updated by admins, readable by all.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Countries are publicly readable.
 * - User profiles are private and can only be read by the owner.
 * - Federations are owned by individual users; only the owner can create, read, update, or delete their federation data.
 * - Players are owned by their parent federation; only the owning federation can create, read, update, or delete player data.
 * - Tournaments can only be created by admins, ensuring controlled tournament management.
 * - Matches can only be created and updated by admins.
 * - Authorization independence is achieved by denormalizing `federationId` into the `Player` documents.
 * - Data validation is limited to authorization-critical fields (e.g., `federationId` on Player creation).
 * - Listing of federations is disallowed for security. Listing of players is only allowed for the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Player` documents contain a denormalized `federationId` field, which matches the parent federation's document ID. This allows direct authorization checks without needing to perform additional `get()` calls.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public `Country` data is stored in a top-level collection, while private `User`, `Federation`, and `Player` data are stored in separate collections or hierarchical structures. This segregation simplifies access control and improves performance.
